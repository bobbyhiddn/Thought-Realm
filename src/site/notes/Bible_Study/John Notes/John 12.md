1. Just in case we rehash the alabaster jar issue, here's a breakdown:
![[Alabaster Jar Anointing.canvas]]

Six days before the Passover, <span style="background:#fff88f">Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus was</span>, the one Jesus had raised from the dead. 2 So they gave a dinner for him there; Martha was serving them, and Lazarus was one of those reclining at the table with him. 3 Then <span style="background:#affad1">Mary took a pound of perfume</span>, pure and expensive nard, anointed Jesus’s feet, and <span style="background:#d3f8b6">wiped his feet with her hair</span>. So the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. 
4 Then one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot (who was about to betray him), said, 5 <span style="background:#ff4d4f">“Why wasn’t this perfume sold for three hundred denarii, and given to the poor?”</span> 6 He didn’t say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief. He was in charge of the money-bag and would steal part of what was put in it. 
7 Jesus answered, “Leave her alone; she has kept it for the day of my burial. 8 <span style="background:#b1ffff">For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.</span>


Christian Standard Bible (Nashville, TN: Holman Bible Publishers, 2020), Jn 12:1–8.

	
<span style="background:#fff88f">While Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper</span>, 7 <span style="background:#affad1">a woman approached him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume.</span> She poured it on his head as he was reclining at the table. 8 When the disciples saw it, they were indignant. “Why this waste?” they asked. 9 <span style="background:#ff4d4f">“This might have been sold for a great deal and given to the poor.” </span>
10 Aware of this, Jesus said to them, “Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a noble thing for me. 11 You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me. 12 By <span style="background:#d3f8b6">pouring this perfume on my </span><span style="background:#d3f8b6">body</span>, she has prepared me for burial. 13 <span style="background:#b1ffff">Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.”</span> 
14 <span style="background:#ff4d4f">Then one of the Twelve, the man called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests </span>15 and said, “What are you willing to give me if I hand him over to you?” So they weighed out thirty pieces of silver for him. 16 And from that time he started looking for a good opportunity to betray him. 


Christian Standard Bible (Nashville, TN: Holman Bible Publishers, 2020), Mt 26:6–16.
	
<span style="background:#fff88f">While he was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper</span>,, as he was reclining at the table, <span style="background:#d3f8b6">a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume of pure nard.</span> She broke the jar and poured it on his <span style="background:#d3f8b6">head.</span> 4 <span style="background:#d3f8b6">But some were expressing indignation to one another: “Why has this perfume been wasted? 5 For this perfume might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and given to the poor.”</span> And they began to scold her. 
6 Jesus replied, “Leave her alone. Why are you bothering her? She has done a noble thing for me. 7 <span style="background:#b1ffff">You always have the poor with you, and you can do what is good for them whenever you want, but you do not always have me.</span> 8 She has done what she could; she has anointed my body in advance for burial. 9 Truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.” 
10<span style="background:#ff4d4f"> Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them. </span>11 And when they heard this, they were glad and promised to give him money. So he started looking for a good opportunity to betray him. 


Christian Standard Bible (Nashville, TN: Holman Bible Publishers, 2020), Mk 14:3–11.


<span style="background:#fff88f">Then one of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him.</span> He entered the Pharisee’s house and reclined at the table. 37 And <span style="background:#d3f8b6">a woman in the town who was a sinner found out that Jesus was reclining at the table in the Pharisee’s house. She brought an alabaster jar of perfume</span> 38 and stood behind him at his feet, weeping, and began to <span style="background:#d3f8b6">wash his feet with her tears. She wiped his feet with her hair, kissing them and anointing them with the perfume. </span>
39 <span style="background:#fff88f">When the Pharisee who had invited him</span> saw this, he said to himself, <span style="background:#ff4d4f">“This man, if he were a prophet, would know who and what kind of woman this is who is touching him—she’s a sinner!”</span> 
40 Jesus replied to him, <span style="background:#fff88f">“Simon, I have something to say to you.” </span>
He said, “Say it, teacher.”
41 “A creditor had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii,, and the other fifty. 42 Since they could not pay it back, he graciously forgave them both. So, which of them will love him more?” 
43 Simon answered, “I suppose the one he forgave more.” 
“You have judged correctly,” he told him. 44 Turning to the woman, he said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet, but she, with her tears, has washed my feet and wiped them with her hair. 45 You gave me no kiss, but she hasn’t stopped kissing my feet since I came in. 46 You didn’t anoint my head with olive oil, but she has anointed my feet with perfume. 47 Therefore I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven; that’s why she loved much. But the one who is forgiven little, loves little.” 48 Then he said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” 




Christian Standard Bible (Nashville, TN: Holman Bible Publishers, 2020), Lk 7:36–48.


8 Afterward he was traveling from one town and village to another, preaching and telling the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him, 2 and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and sicknesses: <span style="background:#d3f8b6">Mary, called Magdalene (seven demons had come out of her)</span>

Christian Standard Bible (Nashville, TN: Holman Bible Publishers, 2020), Lk 8:1–3.

V. 44 - It should seem obvious, but what does Jesus mean here?
